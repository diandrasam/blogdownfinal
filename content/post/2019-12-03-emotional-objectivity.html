<p>As a new teacher you are in stimulation overload all day. You are generally not as organized with your lessons since it may be the first time you have ever taught a particular lesson. You are using so much time to just familiarize yourself with the curriculum that it can be difficult to deliver a well-organized lesson. Developing the ‘withitness’ can be difficult because it’s hard to be aware of everything going on in the room and to nip poor behavior early before it escalates. It can also be exhausting when you are focusing on delivering a lesson but have to be in constant lookout for misbehavior. What is also difficult is to notice what is behavior that can escalate. Sometimes it’s not to tell what is a misbehavior that should be addressed early to avoid escalation. Also as the year goes on you can sometimes look the other way for certain behaviors that are not as extreme such as a side conversation. However not being consistent allows for misbehavior to grow into a bigger problem. So maintaining ‘withitness’ is difficult due to how much energy needs to be utilized to maintain constant redirecting of misbehavior. Now if you are going to police often you are going to have many students who push back in displeasure with the rules. This is where the emotional objectivity comes into play since as a human it can be hard not to take certain actions personally. You have to have a thick skin as a teacher and be willing to not take things students do personally. You have to maintain a level of persistence to maintain a safe working environment for all your students. By maintaining this level of persistence you will no doubt get many students who lash out due to the rules you have in place. It’s important to not let this type of behavior get to you and to continue to remain consistent with enforcing the rules. This is easier said than done since teachers are human also and get tired and frustrated all the same. Overall both the techniques require a level of dedication to stay on top of keeping classroom management in check and for new teachers they can find all of that more overwhelming at first due to not being as organized with lesson plans.</p>
